# Wisperable

Get notified of any ActiveModel events using the [Wisper gem](https://github.com/krisleech/wisper).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wisperable', '~> 0.1'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wisperable

## Usage

Add `import Wisperable::Model` to your models, and configure which events you want to listen for with `wisperable events: [:created, :updated, :destroyed]`

Let's see an example:
```ruby
class Account
  include Wisperable::Model
  wisperable events: [:created, :updated, :destroyed]
end
```

When any create, update or destroy event will happen on an instance of Account, a corresponding `account_created`, `account_updated` or `account_destroyed` will be broadcasted by Wisper.

You can customize the broadcasting key to be used:
```ruby
class Account
  include Wisperable::Model
  wisperable events: [:created, :updated, :destroyed], publish_key: 'user'
end
```

In this key, the broadcast message will be in the form of `user_created`, `user_updated` and `user_destroyed`.

##### Events parameters
`_created` event broadcasts one parameter with the created object.  
`_updated` event broadcasts two parameters with the updated object and the changed attributes.  
`_destroyed` event broadcasts one parameter with a copy of the destroyed model attribute. 

Please see the following example of a PORO (Plain Old Ruby Object) able to intercept Wisperable broadcasts:
```ruby
class AccountNotifier
  def account_created(account)
    # account has been created.
  end
  
  def account_updated(account, changes)
    # account has been updated. 
    # changes contains the changed attributes.
  end
  
  def account_destroyed(account)
    # account contains a copy of the destroyed Account model.
  end
end
```

Please see [Wisper](https://github.com/krisleech/wisper) for any other subscribers setup instruction.
